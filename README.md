The purpose of this project is to make an efficient way to view and analyze multiple stocks by utilizing VBA tools. 


## Results: 

Refactoring allowed us to improve the design of the code at the same time than we preserved functionality.  Before refactoring the aproximate time it took to run the script was about 1 second.

In the following images we can observe the results for the refactored code:
